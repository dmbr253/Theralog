The Import executable will need limitations to ensure the pyautogui function runs on all display and resolution sizes.
It will also need limitations on the user profile of the folder and file path locations because it is specific to one device currently.

For the executable to run properly here are the steps to run the executable script:

  1) Download each of the files from the webserver
  2) Double-Click the Import Executable script
  3) Drag/drop files into the Session_Files folder (DO NOT copy and paste as it will display error)
  4) Once the files are dragged and dropped into the folder, do not touch the keyboard until all information is displayed in the Boris application.
  5) Refer to the Boris User manual for editing features.
